Main_scc parameters:
tlen=18; % window length in s
tinc=0.5; %overlap in s
ThreshCC=0.40; % threshold for cc coef.
Tlow=60; % threshold for sum of envelope amplitudes (below=too faint signal)

Clean_wf parameters:
T=75; % treshold for % energy in the low or high frequencies
Tfhigh=6; %  high frequency to look over for threshold T
Tflow=2; % low frequency to look below for threshold T
Tfmax=75; % threshold for max of energy in the highest peak
