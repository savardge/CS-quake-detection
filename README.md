# CS-quake-detection

This repository contains code from the cross-station correlation detection algorithm for detecting Low Frequency Earthquakes. The original code was in Matlab, but back then I didn't know how to properly structure a package :-) That work was published in BSSA 2015.

This code is not currently organized in a way to be easily distributed. I intend to get back to this work to properly organize the code and remove lines that are specific to the datasets I used. I hope to improve the codes and translated to python at some point.
